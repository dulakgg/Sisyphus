# Sisyphus

- This mod plays Sisyphus music when you die many times at the same checkpoint.

# This mod story:
kitteninabowl messaged me with a great mod idea: a Sisyphus mod that plays Sisyphus audio after the player dies a certain number of times. I said it was a great idea and that I’d make it once my PC was back from warranty. Then it hit me — what better way to make a Sisyphus mod than to live the experience?

So I built the mod on an Xbox using Microsoft Edge and GitHub (no Intelephense), with occasional edits from my phone. kitteninabowl was my tester. It was truly Sisyphean to make — painful in all the right ways — and you can judge by INSERT_COMMITS_NUMBER commits and INSERT_WORKFLOW_RUNS_NUMBER workflow runs. But there we are: it’s done. :)
