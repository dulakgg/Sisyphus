# Sisyphus

- This mod plays Sisyphus music when you die many times at the same checkpoint.
- Rare songs will occasionally play.
- When you idle, a Sisyphus image will appear.
- If you accidentally enter practice mode or fully reset the level while the Sisyphus music is playing… prepare for a jumpscare.

# This mod story

kitteninabowl messaged me with a great idea: a Sisyphus mod that plays Sisyphus audio after the player dies a certain number of times. I said it was a great idea and that I’d make it once my PC was back from warranty. Then it hit me — what better way to make a Sisyphus mod than to live the experience?

So I built the mod on an Xbox using Microsoft Edge and GitHub (no Intelephense), with occasional edits from my phone. kitteninabowl was my tester. It was truly Sisyphean to make — painful in all the right ways — you can tell by 67 commits and 56 workflow runs. But here we are: it’s finally done. :)
